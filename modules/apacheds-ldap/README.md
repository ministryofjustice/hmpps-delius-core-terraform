# Apache DS LDAP

This module creates an EC2 instance configured to an Apache DS LDAP server.
With regard to the load balancers, we are using the **admin** and **managed** naming - due to established naming conventions created while this was planned to be an Oracle OID setup. This will simplfy security group conventions already in place.
